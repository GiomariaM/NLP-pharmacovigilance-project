I then took Evista for about 1 1 / 2 years when my doctor put me on Femara because it is more effective. I was fine in the beginning. After two years or so, I started having pain in my right hip and down my leg where it was uncomfortable to walk. I also developed neuropothy in both feet. I did not understand what the problem was. I went to multiple doctors, and no one could figure out what was going on. A year later I was in so much pain that I had trouble sleeping and could barely walk at all. Long story short, it was the Femara. I have been off of it for a year. After several months, I was not feeling that much better, so ended up going to an accupuncturist only becaus I was desperate! The next day my pain was gone which absolutely amazes me. I still have the neuropathy, but I can deal with that.

The good news is that I only have another 4 and 1 / 2 years! I have pretty much all the side effects with the exception of depression. I exercise 2 hours 5 times per week and this really helps. My joint pain is very severe. I also have extreme pain in both heels and it often takes 15 to 20 steps before the pain subsides when getting out of bed. The night sweats were the worst!

I was having joint and muscle pain, asked my oncologist if I could quit, he agreed. All other symptoms could be attributed to menopause maybe (sleeplessness, no libido, hot flashes, forgetfulness, etc.). Shortly after, I started experiencing extreme shoulder pain. Have been diagnosed with osteoarthritis and am looking at shoulder replacement surgery and am having to give up my job. Doesn\\'t seem possible to have advanced so fast at the age of 50. I also feel like I\\'m 80 or 90 years old! I suppose Femara helped in the fact that I am still cancer free, but live with extreme pain every day.

The are the first two medicines that have caused a bad reaction in me.\\ngained lbs,||always hot,||leg cramps,||foot cramps,||high blood pressure,||high cholestrol,||blurred vision||problems sleeping.||vision blurred.|!|4 years ago I was put on a 5 year Evista program because I was considered high risk for breast caancer. The reason I came to this web site is becase I have always felt that Evista is the cause for other medical problems that started shortly after starting the Evista an no matter what else I do, I can\\'t seem to get rid of. Since I have been on Evista, I have gained about 20 lbs, I am always hot, I suffer leg and foot cramps, high blood pressure, high cholestrol, blurred vision and problems sleeping. These problems all started after I started taking Evista. My doctor does not acknowledge any of these side effects as being caused by the Evista, but he has given me perscriptions for each of my side effects so now I take 4 additional medications for the side effects and I have had 2 new eye glass perscriptions that does not help when the vision is blurred.

It was the worst year of my life. No sleep and constant night sweats. It was close to menopause so I determined the side effects were related. As my osteporosis was not improving with fosomax, I started Evista again about 3 months ago. I have been experiencing terrible leg cramps, back soreness and insomnia. This is the worst drug I have ever taken.

Took myself off this medication in September. The palpations went away first, after a few weeks, but it took three months to get over the pain in my legs, mostly at night. Then I decided I would give it another chance a couple of weeks ago. The palpitations began within a few days and the leg pain started about a couple of days later. I took myself off the medication again last night. This medication also affects, blurs my vision. I will never take another evista pill.\\nrestless nights||forgetfulness(major)|!|I experience restless nights and forgetfulness(major) as I did going through menopause, my cholesterol is up, but my main problem is that my immune system has been severely compromised. I am always sick with whatever is going around. One complaint finishes and next starts. This started within weeks of finishing radiation and starting arimidex. I don\\'t know which of the t / ments would be causing this.I don\\'t take to the bed, but I might have the occasional rest.

I also have chest pain, palpitations. Even though I have a mitral valve I think the medication offsets these symtoms. I wear glasses but my vision seems somewhat more blurred. I even seem to get short term memory losses. I get off the bus everyday and can\\'t see to remember where I parked my car. I\\'m very fatigued and can\\'t sleep so I have to take a sleeping pill every night (Ambien CR) which usually makes you binge.

Then my Oncologist started me on Arimidex which I took for 4 years. No notable side effects until nearing the end of Arimidex except thinning hair. Then my nails started raising from my nail beds. No one willing to blame Arimidex except me. I researched on this site and saw a similar complaint, not many but enough to apply to be taken off. My nails, although poor quality quickly adhered. Between Tamoxifin and Arimidex I was on 5 yrs, max for suggested use in Canada. I have many aging signs that I don\\'t think are necessarily from the drugs.

Weight gain, back / hip / leg pain, leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, joint stiffness, NO libido, and insomnia could all be attributed to menopause, worn out lumbar disk, or lousy luck. The hip pain has been severe at times but x-rays and MRI gave no cause...physical therapy didn\\'t help. Four nights ago I borrowed a Darvocet for the hip pain but had coincidentally run out of Evista that day. After four days OFF Evista my hips are better, knees not stiff, feet don\\'t hurt, and I fall asleep easily. Imagine my surprise after doing some research to find that I have MANY of the symptoms others have developed while taking Evista.

But do know that all of a sudden - literally overnight- at the 3 week point I felt like I had been run over by a train and / or flattened by a piece of heavy construction roller equipment.

I thought that chemo was bad but I felt MUCH worse on the Arimidex. It plunged me into severe depression and horrible joint pains but then my tendons started becoming inflamed and I could hardly walk. I finally had to have surgery as I got a tear in my Achilles tendon, and then broke the leg in two places after having my cast from the surgery off for a month. Not a good time, especially with the sweats and the depression and the feeling that I had cotton for brains. I found it very difficult to concentrate and used to joke that the only good thing about taking Arimidex was that I was alive to complain about it. My doctor finally switched me to Femara after two years as I refused to take the Arimidex anymore. I have been more pleased with the Femara as I haven\\'t been depressed or had as much pain but I am going to go off of it now as I am having all kinds\\nfoot pain.||ankle, pain.||knee pain.||Fingers stiff.||Cannot loose weight|!|severe foot ankle, knee pain.

A few months later, the pain in my shoulders and upper arms caused me sleeplessness and increased difficulty raising my arms over my head. Additionally, I could no longer lift my hand weights due to decreased strength in my arms - I stopped taking the drug!! It is now about 4 months later, and I still have some pain in my upper arms, particularly with deep aching pain during the night.
